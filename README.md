# GitIssueActivity
Activity for practicing with git and issues on GitHub.

For this activity, the students will practice making changes to a GitHub repository. 
The repository has a text file that has been "scrambled" - meaning that random words
have had their characters randomly rearranged, and considered to be issues to be fixed.

The students will:

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository
3. Add the original repository as an upstream remote:
	`git remote add upstream git@github.com:CS-Worcester-CS-348-SP-2018/git-issue-activity.git`
	
4. Repeat as often as possible during the class:
	1. Assign themselves to an issue on GitHub (e.g. issue #42)
	2. Make sure you are on the Master branch: `git checkout master` 
	3. Create a branch named for the issue (e.g. `issue-42`), and switch to that branch:
		`git checkout -b issue-42` 
	4. Edit the `LICENSE.txt` file to correct the issue
	5. Add the change
	6. Pull any changes that have ocurred since their last pull, and correct merge conflicts `git pull upstream master` 
	7. Commit the change, with a message describing the change (include line number and correction, e.g. `Correct misspelling, line 1: UGN -> GNU` )
	8. Push the change
	`git push origin issue-42`
	9. Make a pull request to have their change merged into the original repository.
		1. On GitHub switch to the newly pushed branch.
		2. Click the `New Pull Request` button.
		3. Include in the pull request text a notation that it closes the assigned issue (e.g. `Closes #42`)
		4. Click `Create Pull Request`
		5. Wait for the repository owner to accept the pull request.

The misspellings were generated by the `twiddle.py` program and then entered as issues by the `report.py` program (from this [git-twiddler fork](https://github.com/kwurst/git-twiddler).
